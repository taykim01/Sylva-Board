# Overview
This is an instruction to create an onboarding page (landing page.)

# Problem Framing
This project needs an onboarding page because the users cannot search for this project and there is no way to educate inbound users on what the service is and how to use it.

# Goal
* Create an onboarding page with the following objectives:
1. Shows the user what the services is, quickly and intuitively, so that the user understands how to use the service at a glimpse. See @README.md file and understand what the service is.
2. Focus on a potential problem the user is having, so that the service is more appealing. The main users of this product are university students in their early to mid 20s who tend to adopt to new products faster than others and need a lightweight Notion for personal usage.
3. Comply with the current design system and make the onboarding page aesthetically pleasing.
4. Visually clarify what the user needs to click (i.e. Demo or LogIn page) to make the user inclined to start the service.
